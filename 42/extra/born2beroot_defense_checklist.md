## Born2beRoot defense checklist by [AdrianMussoGonzalez](https://github.com/AdrianMussoGonzalez) (amusso-g)

###### Note: If something does not work as expected or is not clearly explained, stop evaluation. When you need help with checking something, the student should be able to help you.

### Preliminary tests
- [ ] Git repo cloned successfully.

### General instructions
- [ ] Git repo contains a signature.txt file.
- [ ] Check the signature against the students “.vdi” file, make sure it’s identical. 
- [ ] Clone VM || create a snapshot && open VM.

### Mandatory Part (Questions for the student)
- [ ] How does a virtual machine work and what is its purpose?
- [ ] The basic differences between CentOS and Debian?
- [ ] Their choice of operating system?
- [ ] If CentOS: what SELinux and DNF are.
- [ ] If Debian: the difference between aptitude, apt and what APPArmor is.
- [ ] During the defense, a script must display all information every 10 minutes. Its operation will be checked in detail later.
- [ ] All explanations are satisfactory (else evaluation stops here).

### Simple setup
- [ ] Ensure that the machine does not have a graphical environment at launch.
- [ ] Connect to VM as a created user (which isn’t a root)
- [ ] Ensure the password follows the required policy (2 days min, 7, 30 days max).  
`sudo chage -l username`  
- [ ] Evaluator checks UFW service is started.  
`sudo ufw status`  			//look for status: active
- [ ] Evaluator checks SSH service is started.  
`sudo systemctl status ssh`
- [ ] Evaluator checks the chosen operating system (Debian or CentOS).  
`lsb_release -a || cat /etc/os-release`  

### User
- [ ] The subject requests that a user with the login of the student being evaluated is present on the virtual machine. Check that it has been added and that it belongs to “sudo” and “user42” groups.  
`getent group sudo`  
`getent group user42`  

### Password policy check:
- [ ] Create new user (e.g. user42).  
`sudo adduser new_username`  
- [ ] Assign a password of your choice, respecting subject rules.  
`getent group sudo`  
- [ ] Explanation from student explaining how to implement the password policy. 
- [ ] Normally there should be one or two modified files. If there is any problem, the evaluation stops here.
- [ ] With the new user, ask the student to create a group named “evaluating” and assign it to the new user.  
`sudo groupadd evaluating`  
`sudo usermod -aG evaluating your_new_username`  
- [ ] Check if the new user belongs to the “evaluating” group.  
`getent group evaluating`  
- [ ] Ask the student to explain advantages of the password policy (beyond the fact that it is required for the project) 
- [ ] Ask the student the advantages/disadvantages of the policy implementation.

### Hostname and partitions
- [ ] Check the hostname of the machine is correctly formatted as follows: login42 (login of the student being evaluated).  
`hostnamectl`  
- [ ] Modify this hostname by replacing the login with yours, then restart VM.  
`sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname`  
`sudo reboot`  
###### Note:	If on restart, the hostname has not been updated, the evaluation stops here.
- [ ] Restore the machine to the original hostname, then restart VM.  
`sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname`  
`sudo reboot`  
- [ ] Ask the student being evaluated how to view the partitions for the VM.  
`lsblk`
- [ ] Compare the output with the example given in the subject (if there are bonuses, refer to the bonus example).
- [ ] Ask the student for a brief explanation of LVM and how it works.

### SUDO
- [ ] Check that the “sudo” program is properly installed on the virtual machine.  
`dpkg -l | grep sudo`  
- [ ] The student being evaluated shows assigning a new user to the “sudo” group.
- [ ] The subject imposes strict rules for sudo. The student being evaluated must explain the value and operation of sudo using examples of their choice.  
`sudo visudo ls`  
- [ ] Second step, must show the implementation of the rules imposed by the subject.
- [ ] Verify the “/var/log/sudo/” folder exists and has at least one file. Check the contents of the files in the folder, you should see a history of the commands used with sudo.
- [ ] Run a command via sudo. See if the file(s) in the “/var/log/sudo/” folder have been updated.

### UFW
- [ ] Check the “UFW” program is properly installed on the VM and works properly.  
`sudo ufw status numbered`  
- [ ] Ask the student for a basic explanation of UFW and the value of using it.
- [ ] List the active rules in UFW. A rule must exist for port 4242.
- [ ] Add a new rule to open port 8080. Check that this one has been added by listing the active rules.  
`sudo ufw allow 8080`  
- [ ] Delete this new rule with the help of the student being evaluated.  
`sudo ufw delete 4`  
`sudo ufw delete 2`  

### SSH
- [ ] Check that the SSH service is properly installed on the VM, and is working properly.  
`sudo service ssh status`  		//check if its active and port 4242
- [ ] Ask the student for an explanation of what SSH is and the value of using it. (answer: secure shell, allows 2 computers to securely talk to each other)
- [ ] Verify that the SSH service only uses port 4242.
- [ ] Ask the student to help you use SSH in order to log in with the newly created user. To do this, you can use a key or simple password, depending on the student being evaluated.  
`ssh new_user@127.0.0.1 -p 4242`  
- [ ] Make sure you cannot use SSH with the “root” user as stated in the subject.  
`ssh amusso-g42@127.0.0.1 -p 4242`   		//should come up as permission denied

### Script Monitoring (questions for the student)
- [ ] Ask the student how their script works and see their code for it.
- [ ] Script inputted in the monitoring .sh file to display system information  
`cd /usr/local/bin && vim monitoring.sh`  
- [ ] What is “cron”?
- [ ] How does the script run every 10 minutes from when the server starts?
- [ ] Once correct functioning of the script is verified, ask the student to make sure the script runs with dynamic values correctly.  
`sudo crontab -u root -e (***change 10 value to 1***)`  
- [ ] The student being evaluated should make the script stop running when the server has started up, without modifying the script itself. To check this, restart the VM.  
`sudo cronstop`  
`sudo cronstart`  
- [ ] At startup, check if the script still exists in the same place, the rights have remained unchanged and that it has not been modified.  
`sudo reboot`  
`sudo crontab -u root -e`
